# VideoPlaylist

Playlist generator for video files. Usage is rather straightforward:
> VideoPlaylist.cmd <Path to the folder with videos>  <Playlist file name>

For example:
> VideoPlaylist.cmd D:\photos\2023\ Playlist2023.wpl

VideoPlaylist script will find all video files in the path "D:\photos\2023\" and save a playlist in that folder.

Note that WPL is supported by other popular video players, i.e. VLC.
