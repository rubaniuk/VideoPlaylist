# WPLGenerator
Playlist generator for Microsoft Windows Media Player. 

Usage is rather straightforward:
> WPLGenerator.cmd ^<Path to the folder with videos^>  ^<Playlist file name^>

For example:
> WPLGenerator.cmd D:\photos\2023\ Playlist2023.wpl
The script will find all video files in the path "D:\photos\2023\" and save a playlist in that folder.

Note that WPL is supported by other popular video players, i.e. VLC.
